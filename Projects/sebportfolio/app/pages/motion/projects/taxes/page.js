Faced with my first-ever tax bill, I quickly realized just how complicated and frustrating the process could be. I set out to create a lighthearted and comedic video that poked fun at the struggles of navigating taxes as a young adult. This project not only allowed me to develop my motion graphics skills but also gave me a creative outlet to turn a stressful situation into something fun for everyone to have a laugh at."
